### Lead Gen Form w/ Selenium ###

Today I created a fake form that asks about a small business' advertising campaigns and I filled it out with Selenium in Python.
I think that Selenium is a very good module to learn because it forces you to plan and go step-by-step in your code and it's
almost like doing robotic on a budget.
