# Lead Gen Form Automation with Selenium

This project automates the process of filling out a Google Form using Python and Selenium. The form is designed to simulate a **lead generation intake form** for small business advertising, asking questions about industry type, ad spend, marketing channels, and readiness to get started.

The goal: control the browser to intelligently fill out form fields, just like a human would — but faster, more reliably, and repeatably.

## Why I Made This

I created this as a hands-on way to learn Selenium and browser automation. The form itself is fake — just a playground for simulating how small businesses might interact with marketing onboarding flows.

Working with Selenium feels a bit like **robotics for the browser**: you’re writing step-by-step instructions to manipulate real elements on screen. It forces you to slow down, think through page structure, and plan your logic clearly.

## ⚙️ What It Does

- Opens a Google Form using Chrome
- Fills out:
  - Industry text field (e.g. “Roofing”)
  - Ad spend amount via dropdown
  - Checkbox selections for marketing channels
  - Radio buttons for campaign readiness
- Submits the form once all fields are filled

python main.py
You’ll see Chrome open and begin interacting with the form.

What I Learned
How to identify and interact with elements like:

Text inputs

Radio buttons

Checkboxes

Dropdowns

Scrolling into view and clicking hidden or off-screen elements

Dealing with dynamic loading and waits using WebDriverWait

Using XPath effectively to target specific form labels and options

Next Steps / Ideas
Turn this into a form-filling bot that loops over CSV input

Export filled answers to a backend

Add headless support for background automation

Try solving reCAPTCHA or login flows

Final Thoughts
Selenium is more than just a testing tool — it’s an automation Swiss Army knife. Whether you're scraping data, filling out forms, or simulating workflows, it helps you learn how the web really works under the hood.
